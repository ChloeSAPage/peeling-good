# Our Dev Journey

## Our Process

We decided to allocate a page to each other.

-   Index - Chloe
-   About - Conrad
-   Products - Seb

We decided to do this to allow each other a chance of working on HTML, CSS and JS. As well as reduce any conflicts in Git. This was our method until day 3, when we realised the index page required a lot more work. So we each took a section and improved it, based on each other's and Pete's feedback.
